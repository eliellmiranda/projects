ðŸ“˜ Overview

The Bank Reconciliation System is a COBOL project designed to automate the reconciliation of financial transactions between a companyâ€™s internal records and its bank statements.

It identifies missing, duplicate, or mismatched transactions, providing a detailed reconciliation report that improves financial accuracy and auditing efficiency.

This project reflects a real-world use case of COBOL â€” data processing in the financial and banking industry.
